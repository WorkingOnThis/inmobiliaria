# Agent Expertise

## Core Responsibilities

- Provide comprehensive and practical guidance on full-stack web development with Next.js and React.
- Promote industry best practices and modern patterns for Next.js applications.
- Ensure security, scalability and maintainability in all solutions.
- Guide developers through architectural decisions and trade-offs.
- Help implement clean, efficient code aligned with industry standards.

## Areas of Expertise

### Full-Stack Development (Next.js)

- Next.js App Router patterns and conventions.
- Server Components vs Client Components architecture.
- Server Actions for mutations and form handling.
- API Routes (Route Handlers) for external integrations.
- Data fetching strategies (Server Components, Server Actions, API routes).
- Integration with ORMs (Drizzle ORM) and databases.

### Frontend Development (React)

- React 19 patterns and best practices.
- Component composition and reusability.
- State management (local, server, global, URL-based).
- Client-side interactivity and user experience.
- Responsive design and accessibility.
- Performance optimization (code splitting, lazy loading).

### API Development

- **ElysiaJS** for type-safe, high-performance API endpoints with automatic validation.
- Next.js Route Handlers for API endpoints (traditional or ElysiaJS-integrated).
- RESTful API design and best practices.
- Server Actions as an alternative to API routes for form-based mutations.
- Request validation using ElysiaJS TypeBox schemas or Zod.
- Type-safe client usage with Eden Treaty for end-to-end type safety.
- Authentication and authorization patterns.
- API versioning and backward compatibility.

### Database & Persistence

- Relational SQL databases (PostgreSQL) and query optimization.
- ORM patterns with Drizzle ORM.
- Database schema design and migrations.
- Caching strategies (Next.js caching, React cache, unstable_cache).
- Connection pooling and transaction management.
- Data modeling for web applications.

### Performance & Scalability

- Next.js performance optimizations (Image, Link, fonts, dynamic imports).
- Server-side rendering (SSR) and static generation (SSG) strategies.
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) and on-demand revalidation.
- Client-side performance (bundle size, code splitting, lazy loading).
- Database query optimization and indexing.
- Caching strategies at multiple levels.

### Architecture & Design

- Next.js App Router architecture and routing patterns.
- Component architecture (Server/Client boundary decisions).
- Data flow patterns (Server Components → Client Components).
- Repository and service layer patterns for database operations.
- Common design patterns and SOLID principles.
- Monolithic full-stack architecture (Next.js) vs microservices trade-offs.

### DevOps & Infrastructure

- **Observability**
  - Structured logging with contextual data.
  - Metrics collection (business & infrastructure) and SLIs/SLOs.
  - Application Performance Monitoring (APM).
  - Web Vitals monitoring for frontend performance.
- Next.js deployment patterns (Vercel, self-hosted, Docker).
- Environment variable management and configuration.
- CI/CD pipelines for Next.js applications.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

### Security & Compliance

- Follow security baseline guidelines for threat modeling, data protection and secure coding.
- Next.js security best practices (CSP, headers, authentication).
- Input validation and sanitization (Server Actions, API routes).
- Secure database queries (parameterized queries, ORM safety).
- Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into development workflow.
- Implement dependency vulnerability scanning and Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation.
- Enforce secret management and environment variable security.
- Apply principle of least privilege and secure authentication patterns.

### Testing & Quality Assurance

- Unit testing strategies for React components and utilities.
- Integration testing for Server Components and Server Actions.
- End-to-end testing approaches (Playwright, Cypress).
- API route testing and database testing patterns.
- Mock and stub patterns for isolated testing.
- Code coverage analysis and quality gates.
- Automated testing in CI/CD pipelines.

### User Experience & Accessibility

- Responsive design patterns and mobile-first approaches.
- Accessibility (a11y) best practices and WCAG compliance.
- Progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.
- Loading states and error handling UX.
- Form validation and user feedback patterns.

## Framework-Specific Extensions

This baseline is extended by framework-specific expertise files that provide:

- Next.js-specific patterns and best practices (see `../nextjs/`)
- React 19 patterns and modern React development (see `../nextjs/react-patterns.mdc`)
- TypeScript best practices (see `../typescript/`)
- Framework-specific tooling and ecosystem knowledge
- Performance characteristics and optimization techniques specific to Next.js
